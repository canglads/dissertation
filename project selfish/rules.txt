selfish rules:
base on species she work with
low generic diversity
low percentage of males (~25%)
very well self fertilising

main theorem
increase generic diversity of offspring
  -> more resistence

self fertilsing so long
  -> when cross, lots of generic variation

more variable they have, more resistence

in general, more beneficial to self cross
difficulty:
1. find male
2.
3. if well adapt and offspring, chances are offsping do very well, if cross, it might be less adapt

inbreed -> less generic diversity -> less resistence

corss -> 1 female offspring
score -> how many offsping you have in the time

simulation:
males don't appear all the time
playing the game, getting the data out as graph(?)
use that for research


starting senario?
start with male?
is there a way that will end up in that specific situation (model checking)

play with temperature (as a factor)
affect pathogens (some increase, some decrease)
decrease -> more male

without needing computers, using tablet(multiplayer prob won't work)
1 go for eductaional game, 1 simulation(store data)
data at certain time(no males at some time?)

initial state -> allow certain interaction -> state

changes regarding to design -> run on a tablet/store the data

simulation -> can still be a game and have a player

starting senario: start with 1 fish?/ start with population -> more flexibilty
use it as an option

condition: survive, colonize the environment
inbreed -> after many generation -> uniform(slightly different)
cross -> offspring is VERY different


can try to explain in graph in the background session to make people easier to digest

main aim
	subaim
what must happen
what should happen
what could happen

make it appealing

technology aspect, gaming aspect, model checking aspect(optional)


tails -> science festival(me)
both deal with collecting the data -> put it into spreadsheet

data to be collected
time involving (i.e. each second)
keeping adding

to do: try make it run on android
